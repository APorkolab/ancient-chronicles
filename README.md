## About This Project

Welcome to the Ancient Chronicles, a modern digital archive dedicated to preserving and showcasing a collection of personal writings for the Hungarian role-playing game, M.A.G.U.S. (Miracle Adeptia Guns Urrus Sorrate). The content on this site was originally written between 2001 and 2002 and was rediscovered on an old CD in May 2023.

This project was born out of a desire to bring these old creations—monsters, character classes, adventures, and poems—back to life. The website is designed to resemble a "disk magazine" (diskmag), a popular format in the early days of personal computing, and is built with modern web technologies.

Some of the original texts were incomplete and have been finished with the assistance of AI (ChatGPT). The site also features AI-generated music (Suno AI) to enhance the fantasy RPG atmosphere.
